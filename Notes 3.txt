STEP 1:create the following forb elements 
=>Email and password as text boxes and submit button to create the form element 
we required form tax. Also include a header.

<form>
<h1 style="color:red"><u>User details</u></h1>

Email:<input type"text id=1><br><br>
pwd:<input type="text" id=2><br><br>
<button type="button" onclick="details(document.getElementById(1).value,document.getElementById(2).value)">submit</button>

In the above example email is identified by id =1 ,pwd is identified by id=2 .when the submit button is clicked the function details
must get exicuted ,it accepts two parameter 
1=> Email
2=> Password

The data entered for email and password are identified as the value, this value can be retrieved with the help of Id


STEP 2:

After the form tag, start with javascript code which contains:
1: A function named as details which accept two parameter(email,pwd) . Email receives the value through id=1,Pwd receives the value through id=2.
Inside this function perform the following task:

-> Declare and initialize an array of objects with the following details:
1.Email
2.Password


      var users=[ {email:'jeevankv18@gmail.com',
                pwd:12345
                },
              {
                email:'jeevankv16@gmail.com',
                pwd:1234567,
                },
               {
                email:'jeevankv15@gmail.com',
                pwd:12345678,
                }]


-> Initially assume that email id is wrong and password is also wrong 
           
         var isPwdCorrect=false
         var isUserFound=false    

->for each user belonging to users array that is:
   
               for(currentUser in users)

->check the email stored in array compare it with email entered by the user if there is a match the variable isUserFound becomes true
  compare pwd stored in the array with the pwd entered by the user,if there is a match the variable isPwdCorrect becomes true
->if user found is true and if pwd correct true then display the message that you are logged in
->if user found value is true and if pwd correct is false then display the message incorrect password otherwise the user is invalid.
