Javascript primitive data type

String present string in double quotes

Number

Booleans

Difference between == and ===

== is a normal equality condition

=== is a strict equality condition

For normal equality condition content is important

For strict equality condition content as well as type is important

STACK

PUSH operation: we can insert the element at the end of the array using push operation

POP operation: we can delete the last element from the array

Unshift OPERATION: we can insert the element at the beginning of the array using unshift

Shift OPERATION: we can delete the first element from the array

—all the array related method should use name of the array along with dot operated and name of function

Splice(index, number) : it will delete the specified number of elements from mentioned index 

NAME : Dhoni 

Name is called key

Var customers=[“rahul”,”Sourav”,”Sachin”]

for(customer in customers)

Console.log(customer)

alert(cs[c]) for above example var c holds index of each enter of the array first time the value of c is 0 next time the value of c is 1…2 till last index

Such type of for loop is same as for each loop of java

This is used to retrieve each and every element of the array 

Var x=prompt(“enter the first val”)

Var y=prompt(“enter the second val”)

varx1=parseint(x)

Varx2=parseint(y)

alert(x1+x2) //30

In javascript by default the entered value would be stored in the form of string

If at all the value we need to convert the given value into integer form we must use the function parse int this function receive a parameter of type string and convert that type into number in the form integer 

Js,python is know as dynamically typed language where datatype of a variable is decided by the type of input we are going assign to a variable

C,cs,java is known as statically typed language
